# C-SharpLiveProject - Comments Section

## Introduction

I worked in an Agile/Scrum environment to build an application demonstrating proficiency with C# in ASP .NET MVC and Entity Framework. My main responsibility was to create a comments section as a component of a website as per the client's requests and I completed my tasks according to the user stories assigned to me. 

We used Azure DevOps to manage our repositories and user stories. I developed a productive workflow after familiarizing myself with the tools at my disposal. 

Over the two week sprint I had many opportunities to learn what it means to work as part of a team on a single project.

Here are some of the highlights from the project:

## Create and Style About Page

Based on a mockup, I created a page for viewing the information about the company, it's mission and the employees.

## Create Comment Model and CRUD Pages

I created the model for the comments and scaffolded the CRUD pages. Create, read, update and delete functionality was created for the comments.

## Comments Partial View

I made a partial view to be inherited by each comments page for code reusability.
