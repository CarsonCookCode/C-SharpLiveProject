# C-SharpLiveProject

## Introduction

I worked in an Agile/Scrum environment to build an application demonstrating proficiency with C# in ASP .NET MVC and Entity Framework. My main responsibility was to create a comments section as a component of a website as per the client's requests and I completed my tasks according to the user stories assigned to me. We used Azure DevOps to manage our repositories and user stories. I developed a productive workflow after familiarizing myself with the tools at my disposal. Over the two week sprint I had many opportunities to learn what it means to work as part of a team on a single project.

Here are some of the highlights from the project:

## Create and Style About Page

## Create Comment Model and CRUD Pages

## Link Comment and Blog Post

## Show and Create Comments by Blog Post

## Comments Partial View

## Styling the Comments

## Like/Dislike Implementation

## Delete Button

## Create & Reply Functionality
